## React Bookshelf App
This application allows users to organize a collection of books into three categories of "Currently Reading", "Read" and "Want to Read."  The application demonstrates the power of React.js as a tool for building fast and efficient user-interfaces.  **All JS/React code written by myself**.

## Instructions
In order to use this application a user must download the program files. The program can then be accessed using a command line interface tool, such as "terminal" in macs, by running "npm install" and then "npm start" in the terminal after having opened up the file containing the application. 

## Project Background
This application also utilizes React-Router, Prop-Types, and Sort-By.
